### Table of Contents

## Intro

Hello everyone! Welcome to the second part of my devlog for **Survival Sprint: Fury of the Boss**. Today, I will talk about the last things I worked on before finishing the game prototype. I focused on these parts:

1. **Final work on the splash screen and user interface**.
2. **Adding the virtual joystick for mobile controls**.
3. **Finishing the physics layers to control game objects**.

## 1. Splash Screen and User Interface

In the past weeks, I made the game’s user interface better, and now I finished the splash screen. I added a minimum time for the splash screen and changed the design to make it look nice.

### Key changes:

- **Splash screen color**: The final color is a deep blue, which makes the game look more professional.
- **Game logo**: I added a game logo to make the screen unique.

## 2. Virtual Joystick for Mobile Controls

To finish mobile controls, I added a virtual joystick. This joystick makes it easier for mobile players to control the character. Now, all the important control features are done.

### What I did:

- Added and set up the virtual joystick plugin.
- Made the controls work better for mobile screens.

## 3. Physics Layers: Final Setup

To finish the physics for game objects, I added the final layers to control how objects in the game interact. Now, each type of object has its own layer, which helps make everything work well.

### Final physics layers:

- **Wall** — walls
- **Player** — the player
- **Enemies** — enemies
- **Bullets** — bullets
- **Items** — items

With these changes, the game prototype is almost done. In the next part of the devlog, I will talk about the final boss fight and how I will finish the game.
