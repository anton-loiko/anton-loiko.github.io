## Showcase

{VIMEO::}970075397{::END}

After going through this tutorial, I realized that creating simple and engaging games, like Roguelites or those similar to Vampire Survivors, can be quite easy and quickly achievable.

Why Godot? Itâ€™s lightweight, powerful, intuitive, completely free, and open source, allowing developers to modify and adapt the software to their needs.

Throughout this project, I learned how to code player movement, create weapons, and generate enemies that randomly appear and move towards the player, as well as manage character and enemy health. We thoroughly explored the Godot interface, learned about character creation and setup, adding collisions, and writing simple GDScript scripts to control object behavior.

This experience has been an excellent starting point for further exploring Godot and game development.
