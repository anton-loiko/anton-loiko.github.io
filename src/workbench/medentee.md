**Feb. 2021 - May 2024 | London, England · Remote**

- Spearheaded the development of a comprehensive **event management platform** from inception, focusing on creating a scalable and robust architecture that could support a variety of features tailored to the healthcare industry. The platform included a custom **cloud storage infrastructure** and an advanced **messenger system** with features such as **P2P**, **Group Chats**, and **voice channels.**
- **Designed and developed administrative web portal** for managing users, configuring event settings, and overseeing platform operations. That portal provided administrators with the tools necessary to manage the platform effectively and ensure smooth operation. Made the decision to use Ant Design with minimal customization to accelerate development. Worked closely with the designer to ensure a consistent user experience aligned with this component library.
- Created a custom UI library using **React.js** and **TypeScript**, complemented by **Storybook** for documentation and testing. This library standardized the platform's look and feel, reducing development time and ensuring consistency across all components.
- Delivered key features that elevated the platform’s functionality:
  - **Networking Potential**: Developed tools to facilitate connections between attendees, making networking a seamless and integral part of the platform.
  - **Custom Event Channels**: Implemented channels for real-time news and updates, keeping users informed and engaged throughout events.
  - **Live Events**: Built a live streaming feature that expanded the reach of events globally, allowing participants to engage in real-time regardless of location.
- Focused on enhancing the productivity and communication of healthcare teams by centralizing all communication channels, including video meetings, into a single platform. This allowed for more efficient management of departments and smoother collaboration among team members.
- Drove the creation of a robust **healthcare networking system** that enabled professionals to maintain their contacts and data even when changing organizations, ensuring continuity and fostering long-term professional relationships.
